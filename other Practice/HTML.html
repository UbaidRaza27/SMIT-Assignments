  <pre>    HTML 3.2[16] was published as a W3C Recommendation.
    It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C,
    as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[17]
    Initially code-named "Wilbur",[18] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely,
    reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most
    of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's
    marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.
    [14] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML.
